                       The goal of this lab was to create functions that take user input in javascript. We then had to transfer 
                       this to a javascript file, that we linked to this html page and created a way for the input to be shown.

                </div>

                    <h2> 
                        Challenges
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We encountered little to no challenges with this lab. During sections we were able to ask questions and understand 
                        the concepts needed to complete this lab very well. After creating the functions able to take user input we made
                        creative ways to display this info here on this html.

                    <p>
                        The results of this lab are within this page, the script output is a result of the javascript file we 
                        created and linked into this html page. We also included some screenshots to show what is happening behind
                        the scenes for the output to be shown on this page.  
                    </p>

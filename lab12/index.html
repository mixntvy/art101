                <div id="subject">
                    <h2>

                       The goal of this lab was to utilze conditional statements in order to create a sorting device within our site that
                       takes user input via input field and runs it through conditionals to produce a result!
            
                    </p>
                    
                </div>

                    <h2> 
                        Challenges

                    <p>
                        We struggled a bit with the the javascript for this lab because we had to create a fucntion that used users input 
                        and was able to store this input in order to use it within a different function attached to the button icon. I also
                        to add visual elements to my website for people to reference when they are sorted however I was struggling with flex items. 
                        I ended up relying on W3Schools for help on how to figure this out, and got it working!
                    </p>

                <div id="results">
                        <h2>
                            Results
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The results of this lab can be viewed by adding your own input into the field we created! :D Inspecting the page and 
                            looking at the console will also show you what is happening behind the scenes when the buttons are clicked.  
                            We also included some screenshots to show our code. Have fun being sorted!

                       The goal of this lab was to practice making variables using the console within our 
                       browers and then implement those variables within our javascript file for Lab 5. We 
                       were tasked with making those variables in javascript and then linking them into this 
                       html page to show the output.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We encountered little to no challenges with this lab. Every part of this lab was relatively 
                        easy to understand. We picked up the new material pretty fast and were able to finish this lab up
                        quickly. :D

                        Results

                        The results of this lab are within this page, the script output is a result of the javascript file we 
                        created and linked into this html page. We also included some screenshots to show what is happening behind
                        the scenes for this page to run. The mazda referenced below in the javascript is the car that I own, I wasn't 
                        able to bring it with me to college, so I miss it.

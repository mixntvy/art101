					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we had to create a webpage from scratch with an html file that included "Hello World! and write 
						a paragraph about ourselves and our partner. Then use css to change the color and make it look nice. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose for me were linking the css sytlesheet to the html document and how to get images to
						be manipulated within the webpage using css. We solved them by following the examples and looking through W3School
						tutorials. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I believe it went well, after we both started to understand the material and look through W3Schools tutorials a bit 
						we were able to grasp the concepts needed for this lab. We put alot of effort into this assignment by researching
						and using each other to find our own solutions to the problems we had. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We suceeded in creating a webpage using both html and css elements !</p>

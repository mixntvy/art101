                       The goal of this lab was to familiarize oursleves with the concepts of arrays and objects in javascript.
                       We did this by creating some within the console of our chosen web browers and then asking it to pull information
                       from them. We then had to transfer this to a javascript file, that we linked to this html page and created a way 
                       for the input to be shown. 
            
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We encountered little to no challenges with this lab. We were able to complete each part of this lab was relatively 
                        easily and understood the material. We picked up the creation of new arrays and objects pretty fast and were able to 
                        finish this lab up quickly.

                        The results of this lab are within this page, the script output is a result of the javascript file we 
                        created and linked into this html page. We also included some screenshots to show what is happening behind
                        the scenes for the output to be shown on this page.

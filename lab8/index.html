                <div id="output"></div>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>
                        Subject
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                       The goal of this lab was to create and experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks 
                       in our browers console. We then had to transfer this to a javascript file, that we linked to this html
                       page and created a way for the input to be shown. 
            
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <h2> 
                        Challenges
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We encountered little to no challenges with this lab. We struggled a bit with calling these functions a few times
                        but they were mostly because of learning new syntax. During sections we were able to ask questions and understand 
                        the concepts needed to complete this lab very well. After creating the functions able to take user input we made
                        creative ways to display this info here on this html.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <h2>
                        Results
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The results of this lab  can be viewed by inspecting the page and looking at the console! 
                        Instead of creating a bypass for allowing the javascript to be shown we linked it correctly within the head tags of our html. 
                        We also included some screenshots to show what is happening behind the scenes.  
                    </p>

                       The goal of this lab was to work with jQuery and utilze making buttons and input fields that take user input and display
                       it on our webpages. It takes user input and shuffles it around to create something new!
            
                    </p>
                    
                </div>

                <div id="challenges">
                    <h2> 
                        Challenges

                    <p>
                        We struggled a bit with the the javascript for this lab because we had to work with existing functions that javascript has 
                        within its program, such as .val(), .split(), .sort(), and .join(). We were familiar with a few of these which helped 
                        some but they were still a pretty new concept compared to other things this lab required. We also wanted our output to be 
                        capitalized on our page so we incorperated that which turned out to be more difficult that expected, we ended up asking 
                        Wesbot for help and were able to figure out a solution based on its suggestions. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="results">
                        <h2>
                            Results
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The results of this lab can be viewed by adding your own input into the field we created! :D Inspecting the page and 
                            looking at the console will also show you what is happening behind the scenes when the buttons are clicked. 
                            Instead of creating a bypass for allowing the javascript to be shown we linked it correctly within the head tags of our html. 
                            We also included some screenshots to show our code.

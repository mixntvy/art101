                <div id="subject">
                    <h2>
                        Subject

                       The goal of this lab was to work with jQuery and utilze making buttons that take strings of data and distribute them
                       into textboxes upon the press of a button. Try it for yourself!
            
                    </p>
                    
                </div>

                <div id="challenges">
                    <h2> 
                        Challenges
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We struggled a bit with the css and figuring out how to get it to make message boxes. After looking 
                        at the professors website we learned that he was using a fucntion within his css that was allowing 
                        each newly generated text to have a different appearance in the css.  
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="results">
                        <h2>
                            Results
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The results of this lab can be viewed by interacting with the buttons we created! :D Inspecting the page and 
                            looking at the console will also show you what is happening behind the scenes when the buttons are clicked. 
                            Instead of creating a bypass for allowing the javascript to be shown we linked it correctly within the head tags of our html. 
                            We also included some screenshots to show our code. 
                        </p>

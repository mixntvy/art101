                       The goal of this lab was to work with jQuery and link the library to our html so we could utilize it.
                       During the lab we created buttons that changed the css of our page upon being pressed. Try it for yourself!
            
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
                <div id="challenges">
                    <h2> 
                        Challenges
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We struggled a bit with the css over lapping with our site css, and not allowing the special div we created to be 
                        shown when the button were clicked. However after inspecting our code we were able to figure out the problem 
                        and fix it so that it ran more smoothly without interferring with the jQuery library. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="results">
                    <h2>
                        Results
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The results of this lab can be viewed by interacting with the buttons we created! :D Inspecting the page and 
                        looking at the console will also show you what is happening behind the scenes when the buttons are clicked. 
                        Instead of creating a bypass for allowing the javascript to be shown we linked it correctly within the head tags of our html. 
                        We also included some screenshots to show our code. 
                    </p>

                       The goal of this lab was to work with APIs and JSON to pull data from API endpoints and display them on our 
                       webpages! 
            
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We ran into one issue with this lab which was that when we were attempted to pull from the orginal site 
                        we ran into a CORS error from the console. This is the same issue the professor ran into in class and wasnt able
                        to fix before the class was over. We decided to ask Wesbot for some help but he was only able to give us information
                        about the error. So after some failed research we decided to ask ChatGPT and it suggested some changes to our 
                        javascript that allowed us to display the image for the comic! Despite this, we got this working 
                        we were able to complete the lab with minimal problems.

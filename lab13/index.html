                       The goal of this lab was to work with loops in order to create an array that displayed data values in our html page.

                        We struggled a bit with the the javascript for this lab because we didn't know how to display our javascript in 
                        html. This turned out to be more difficult that expected, we ended up asking 
                        Wesbot for help and were able to figure out a solution based on its suggestions as well as looking at W3Schools.

                       In this lab we were required to create pseudocode for two activites, an everyday task and a simple game.
                       Once we created the pseudocode we then added them to a javascript file inside of our lab 4 folder and 
                       created a new html for lab 4. We then had to display our results in this html folder inside of lab 4.

                        The most challenging thing about this lab was finding a game and everyday task that was not 
                        so overly complicated that we would get wrapped up creating a simple pseudocode for. We discussed 
                        and made lists of a few ideas that we had before choosing one that was reasonable and fit the requirements 
                        of the assignment.

                        Everyday Task: How to change a light bulb

                        //Remove any external covers to the fixture such as covers, fittings, shades, etc.
                        //Remove the old bulb after it has reached a cool temperature
                        //Apply the new bulb
                            //Align it carefully into the fixture
                        //Reassemble the fixture cover
                        //Restore power to test the new bulb functionality
                        //Dispose of the old bulb safely

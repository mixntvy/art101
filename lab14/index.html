                       The goal of this lab was to work with debugging tools and stratgies to fix issues in the codes of our previous labs
                       to help them run smoother. It was also to help us identify any issues we were having previously so that we could solve them.

                    <p>
                        There weren't many challenges that we encountered in this lab. Since we were working with code that we had previously created
                        we were familar enough to understand and logic out what the issues we were having would be.

                            <p> These are screenshots of the old code and new code with debugs.
                                On the top left is a screenshot of the orginal code without any debugging and the right shows the 
                                new debugged code with comments!</p>
                            </br>
                            <p> Adding these console logs to the code to help with debugging has showed me issues that I was experiencing with
                                my code during the time of this lab, that I had got working but wasnt fully sure what was wrong. During the initial
                                lab I ran across the issue of not being able to see if the input field was taking in information from users and 
                                storing that info, or if it was feeding off of another value to generate results. Going through with the decoding 
                                strategy let me realize that it was in fact feeding off another value to generate its results. Having the 
                                console.log(nameLength) is there now shows me that its actually pulling values from user input like I was hoping 
                                it would! </p>

                       The goal of this lab was to work with APIs, JSON and AJAX to pull data from API endpoints and display them on our 
                       webpages!
            
                    </p>
                    
                </div>

                <div id="challenges">
                    <h2> 
                        Challenges

                    <p>
                        We struggled a bit with the the javascript for this lab, we attempted to set up our js similar to the live coding
                        section from the previous lecture and this worked to a certain degree. However because each API is different 
                        we have to create a unique object for our code to use in order to be able to pull from the site. After we got this working 
                        we were able to complete the lab with minimal problems.

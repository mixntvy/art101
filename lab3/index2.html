                <p>
                    The purpose of this lab was to create a local file strucutre on our 
                    computers, add index.html files and upload them to our main server. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Creating and adding the file structure to my computer was not particularly 
                    difficult. However, customizing my homepage to incorperate links to these lab 
                    assignments is where I had a bit of difficulty.
